## üìù **SQL Assignment: Practice CRUD with `products` Table**

### üéØ Objective:

Create a table named `products` in the `fla` schema and perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), along with filtering and sorting queries.

---

### üîß **Step 1: Create Table**

Create the `products` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fla.products (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  description VARCHAR(300),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: INSERT (Create)**

Insert at least 5 sample products into the table. Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO fla.products (id, name, price, quantity, description)
VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 65000.00, 10, '14-inch i5 laptop with 8GB RAM'),
(2, 'Smartphone', 32000.00, 20, 'Android phone with AMOLED display'),
(3, 'Keyboard', 1200.50, 50, 'Mechanical keyboard with backlight'),
(4, 'Mouse', 800.00, 40, 'Wireless mouse with 3 DPI modes'),
(5, 'Monitor', 12500.00, 15, '24-inch Full HD Monitor');
```

---

### üîç **Step 3: SELECT (Read)**

1. Retrieve all products.
2. Retrieve only product name and price.
3. Retrieve products with quantity more than 15.

```sql
SELECT * FROM fla.products;

SELECT name, price FROM fla.products;

SELECT * FROM fla.products WHERE quantity > 15;
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è **Step 4: UPDATE**

1. Update the price of the ‚ÄúMonitor‚Äù to 13000.00.
2. Change the quantity of the ‚ÄúKeyboard‚Äù to 45.

```sql
UPDATE fla.products
SET price = 13000.00
WHERE name = 'Monitor';

UPDATE fla.products
SET quantity = 45
WHERE name = 'Keyboard';
```

---

### üóëÔ∏è **Step 5: DELETE**

1. Delete the product with `id = 4`.
2. Delete all products with quantity less than 10.

```sql
DELETE FROM fla.products
WHERE id = 4;

DELETE FROM fla.products
WHERE quantity < 10;
```

---

### üîÉ **Step 6: Filtering & Sorting**

1. Display all products with price greater than 5000.
2. Sort all products by name in ascending order.
3. Sort all products by price in descending order.

```sql
SELECT * FROM fla.products WHERE price > 5000;

SELECT * FROM fla.products ORDER BY name ASC;

SELECT * FROM fla.products ORDER BY price DESC;
```
